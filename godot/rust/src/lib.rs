//! `asteroid_gdext` — the GDExtension binding that exposes the headless,
//! deterministic [`asteroid_core`] physics to the Godot Phase-2 frontend.
//!
//! **Dependency direction is one-way:** this crate depends on `asteroid_core`;
//! no Godot type ever links back into the core (HANDOFF §10 invariant — the
//! core stays renderer-free so it remains the single validated source of truth).
//!
//! This is **Commit 1: the toolchain gate.** It exposes a single class with one
//! method returning the core's version string. Reading that string back from
//! GDScript empirically proves three things at once — GDExtension class
//! registration, the Rust↔Godot FFI boundary, and that a gdext build loads in
//! Godot 4.7 (runtime ≥ API version forward-compat) — *before* any physics,
//! kernels, or heavy compute are wired in (that lands in Commit 2).
